# Ludo Game Design

This project is a C++ implementation of a simplified Ludo-style board game. The design focuses on a modular, event-driven approach that allows flexibility, extensibility, and clear separation of responsibilities across game components.

## Overview

The game is designed with a focus on modularity and scalability, allowing it to be easily extended or modified. The primary components include a **Board** containing various types of **Tiles**, **Players** with different pawns, and an **Event Loop** to handle gameplay logic and player interactions. 

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

## Design Approach

The game design is centered around object-oriented principles and a clean separation of concerns. Key concepts include:

- **Modular Design**: Each game component is isolated in its own class, allowing easier debugging, testing, and future modification.
- **Event-Driven Logic**: An event loop handles game actions, such as moving pawns, rolling the dice, and managing player turns.
- **Flexible Board Layout**: The game board is represented by a collection of tiles, each of which can be one of several specialized types (e.g., SafeTile, FinishingTile). This structure provides a flexible layout that can support different game rules.

## Key Components

### 1. Tile and Board

- **Tile Class**: Represents a single space on the board, with specific properties such as coordinates, color, size, and a unique ID.
- **Special Tiles**: Derived classes include:
  - `StartingTile`: The initial position for pawns of each player.
  - `SafeTile`: Allows pawns to be safe from capture.
  - `PrefinishTile`: Leads pawns to the finishing path.
  - `FinishingTile`: Final tiles where pawns must land to finish.
- **Board Class**: Holds and manages a collection of tiles. It includes methods for adding, retrieving, and sorting tiles, as well as initializing the game board layout.

### 2. Player and Pawn

- **Player Class**: Represents each player in the game, with properties such as ID, color, and pawns.
- **Pawn Class**: Represents individual pawns for each player. Each pawn has a position and a unique ID, and moves according to the rules of the game.
  
### 3. Event System

- **Event Loop**: Manages the flow of the game by handling events such as player turns, pawn movements, and dice rolls. Events are processed in a queue, allowing asynchronous handling and easy integration of new game actions.
- **Event Handlers**: Specific actions, such as moving a pawn or changing turns, are implemented as handlers. The event system uses these handlers to keep game logic modular and flexible.

## Event-Driven Design

The event-driven approach allows us to decouple the game logic from the actual sequence of events. Key events include:

1. **Player Turn Event**: Signals the start of a player’s turn.
2. **Roll Dice Event**: Generates a random roll value and triggers pawn movement.
3. **Move Pawn Event**: Moves a pawn based on the dice roll, applying any special tile rules.
4. **Game End Event**: Signals the end of the game when a player achieves the winning condition.

This approach ensures that the game flow is controlled by events, making it easier to handle complex interactions and add new features without restructuring the core logic.

## Tile Types and Game Board

Each tile type is derived from the base `Tile` class, adding specific behaviors and properties as needed:

- **SafeTile**: Pawns on this tile are safe from capture.
- **PrefinishTile**: Links to a player’s finishing tiles, where they must land exactly to win.
- **FinishingTile**: A final series of tiles where each player’s pawns need to reach the end to win the game.

The `Board` class manages all tiles and is responsible for initializing them with their correct positions, colors, and sizes.

### Example Code Snippet

```cpp
// Adding a SafeTile to the board
Color safeColor(0, 255, 0);   // Green color for SafeTile
Size tileSize(20, 20);        // Standard tile size

board.addSafeTile(5, 5, 2, 10, safeColor, tileSize); // Example tile addition
```

## Future Improvements

- **AI for Single Player**: Implement AI logic for automated opponents.
- **Additional Game Rules**: Add more complex game rules or optional variations.
- **Network Multiplayer**: Allow multiple players to play over a network connection.
- **UI Enhancements**: Integrate a graphical interface for a more interactive experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
